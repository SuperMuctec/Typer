# ⌨️ Typer 

**Typer** is a Python terminal application that animates text as if it's being typed out in real-time. It offers two modes and is highly customizable, making it ideal for creating dynamic terminal interactions.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Two Typing Modes 🥈**:
  - **Real Mode**: Simulates real typing by printing characters one at a time and erases it, reflecting user typing speed.
  - **Fake Mode**: Animates the typing effect without actual input, giving the illusion of typing.
