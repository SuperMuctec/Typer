# Typer

**Typer** is a Python terminal application that animates text as if it's being typed out in real-time. It offers two modes and is highly customizable, making it ideal for creating dynamic terminal interactions.

## Key Features

- **Two Typing Modes**:
  - **Real Mode**: Simulates real typing by printing characters one at a time and erases it, reflecting user typing speed.
  - **Fake Mode**: Animates the typing effect without actual input, giving the illusion of typing.
  
- **Customizability**: 
  - Full control over speed, and mode.
  - All parameters are configurable, allowing users to tailor the experience to their preferences.
  
- **Multi-File Architecture**: 
  - The code is split into multiple files for better organization and readability, making it easier to maintain and extend.
